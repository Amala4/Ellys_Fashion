                        <p>Afashion season can be defined as much by the people on the catwalk as it can by the
                            clothes they are wearing. This time around, a key moment came at the end of Marc Jacobs’
                            New York show, when an almost makeup-free Christy Turlington made a rare return to the
                            catwalk, aged 50 (she also stars, with the designer himself, in the label’s AW ad
                        campaign), where the average catwalk model is around 18.</p>
                        <p>A few days later, Simone Rocha arguably upped the ante. The 32-year-old’s show – in part
                            inspired by Louise Bourgeois, who lived until she was 98 – featured models in their 30s
                        and 40s, including cult favourite Jeny Howorth and actor Chloë Sevigny.</p>
